# File Description:
# Configuration file for 0D box model of collisions using CLEO.
# Note: The inital superdroplets data read from file "initsupers_filename" can be made with
# CLEO's pySD module (see Python script "scripts/collisions0d/initconds.py" for usage) and likewise
# for "grid_filename".

### SDM Runtime Parameters ###
